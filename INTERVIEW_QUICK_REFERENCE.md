# Portfolio Project - Quick Reference Card

## 🎯 Core Pitch
**Terminal-inspired portfolio with AI-powered queries, live GitHub/GitLab stats, and real shipped products**

## 🔢 Key Numbers
- **3** production products (+ 1 community project)
- **111** days in contribution heatmap
- **1 week** ISR cache duration
- **~200MB** Docker image size
- **0** unnecessary features

## 💡 Unique Selling Points
1. **Interactive terminal** - Query portfolio like a system
2. **Hybrid AI** - Fast local commands, smart Gemini fallback
3. **Live activity** - Real GitHub/GitLab data, not static
4. **Real products** - Everything shipped to production
5. **Intentional restraint** - Every feature earns its place

## 🛠 Tech Stack (One Line)
**Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Google Gemini AI + Docker + Google Cloud Run**

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
"Like internal documentation, not a marketing site"

## 🚀 Products Shipped
1. **Paychasers** - Automated invoice follow-ups (SaaS)
2. **Quicksalaries** - Salary data platform (Backend-free)
3. **Swyftswap** - Airtime-to-crypto (Blockchain)
4. **Cape Community Blog** - Built from scratch (Commission)

## 🤖 AI Integration
```
Simple Query → Local Handler → Instant
Complex Query → Google Gemini → Intelligent
```

## 📊 Performance Wins
- Commands like 'help' = **0ms** (no API)
- Activity data cached = **1 week**
- Docker multi-stage = **60% smaller image**
- Scales to zero = **$0 when idle**

## 🔥 Best Technical Decision
"Hybrid query router - simple commands never hit the AI"

## 😅 Fun Fact
"The 111-day heatmap uses deterministic pseudo-random patterns for missing days - same pattern every render, but looks naturally varied"

## 🎤 If Asked "Why This Approach?"
"I wanted to show how I actually work - pragmatic, ship-focused, and biased toward execution. The terminal interface lets people explore my work the way developers explore systems - through queries and commands."

## 🔗 The Thing I'm Most Proud Of
"The restraint. It would've been easy to add more features, animations, or AI capabilities. But this does exactly what it needs to do, nothing more."

## Emergency Pivots

**If they say "seems over-engineered":**
"Actually, it's intentionally minimal. No auth system, no database, no user accounts. Just a static site with smart progressive enhancement."

**If they say "why not just use a template":**
"This portfolio IS my demonstration of technical capability. Using a template would miss the point."

**If they say "AI seems unnecessary":**
"It's optional enhancement. The site is fully functional without it. But when someone asks 'which product uses blockchain?', Gemini can answer instantly."

**If stumped on a technical detail:**
"Let me walk you through the architecture at a higher level first, then we can dive into that specific implementation detail..."

Remember: **You built software that ships. The portfolio is just proof.**
